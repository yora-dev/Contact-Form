## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox**
- **CSS Grid**
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for form validation and toast message

### What I learned

This project helped me practice **form validation logic** and **accessible form design**.  
I learned how to:

- Display error messages dynamically and link them to input fields for screen readers
- Use `aria-live` regions to announce success and error states
- Improve usability by supporting full **keyboard navigation**

### Continued development

**In the future, Iâ€™d like to:**

- Add real backend integration (e.g., sending messages via an API)
- Improve form accessibility with more detailed ARIA attributes
- Explore using React or Vue to build more complex forms with dynamic fields

### Useful resources

- MDN - Form Validation
